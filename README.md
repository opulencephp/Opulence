## Introduction
**Opulence** is a PHP web application framework that simplifies the difficult parts of creating and maintaining a secure, scalable website.  With Opulence, things like database management, caching, ORM, page templates, and routing are a cinch.  It was written with customization, performance, and best-practices in mind.  Thanks to test-driven development (TDD), the framework is reliable and thoroughly tested. Opulence is split into components, which can be installed separately or bundled together.

## Installation
Opulence can be installed using Composer:

```
composer create-project opulence/project --prefer-dist
```
